# Hangman Word Game
## Introduction
This is an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer, which is a variation of the classic wordgame Hangman 
(the second player will always be the computer who will be picking a word at random).
* This game is written in Python 2, and may need some adjustment to run under Python 3.
* Two files are included: 1) hangman_game.py; 2) word.txt.

## Rules of the game
* A player is allowed 8 guesses and is only allowed to submit one character at a time (A-Z).
* A player loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.
* If the player guesses the same letter twice, s/he will not be taken away a guess - instead, a message will be printed to let them know they've already guessed that letter and to ask them to try again.
* The game will end when the player constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. 

## Installation and Usages
* Downlaod all files in this repository and save them in the same folder.
* Run hangman_game.py to play the game.
